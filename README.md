# Power Generation Cost Optimization

## Overview

This project implements an optimization model for minimizing the cost of power generation across multiple power plants while meeting customer demand. The model addresses the economic dispatch problem with unit commitment, determining which power plants to operate and at what capacity to minimize total generation costs.

## Problem Context

In electrical power systems, operators must decide:
- Which power plants to turn on (unit commitment)
- How much power each plant should generate (economic dispatch)

This is challenging because:
- Each plant has different operating costs per MW
- Plants have minimum and maximum capacity constraints
- Some plants may be more efficient but have limited capacity
- Turning a plant on requires it to produce at least its minimum output

## Visual Representation

![Power Generation Problem](pb_modelisation_simplified.png)

The diagram shows three power plants (Centrales 1-3) supplying electricity to a client, each with different:
- **Cost per MW**: Plant 1 (5€/MW) > Plant 2 (4€/MW) > Plant 3 (3€/MW)
- **Capacity**: Plant 1 (100 MW) < Plant 2 (150 MW) < Plant 3 (200 MW)
- **Minimum output**: Plant 1 (20 MW) < Plant 2 (30 MW) < Plant 3 (40 MW)

## Mathematical Formulation

### Problem Definition

We formulate this as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem that combines:
- **Continuous variables**: Power generation levels
- **Binary variables**: On/off status of each plant

### Sets and Indices
- $I = \{1, 2, 3\}$ : Set of power plants

### Parameters
- $c_i$ : Cost per MW for plant $i$ (€/MW)
  - $c_1 = 5$ €/MW
  - $c_2 = 4$ €/MW  
  - $c_3 = 3$ €/MW

- $C_i$ : Maximum capacity of plant $i$ (MW)
  - $C_1 = 100$ MW
  - $C_2 = 150$ MW
  - $C_3 = 200$ MW

- $M_i$ : Minimum production level of plant $i$ when operational (MW)
  - $M_1 = 20$ MW
  - $M_2 = 30$ MW
  - $M_3 = 40$ MW

- $D$ : Client demand (MW)

### Decision Variables
- $x_i$ : Power generated by plant $i$ (MW), $x_i \geq 0$, continuous
- $y_i$ : Binary variable indicating if plant $i$ is operational
  - $y_i = 1$ if plant $i$ is on
  - $y_i = 0$ if plant $i$ is off

### Objective Function
Minimize total generation cost:

$$\min Z = \sum_{i \in I} c_i \cdot x_i$$

$$\min Z = 5x_1 + 4x_2 + 3x_3$$

### Constraints

### 1. Demand Satisfaction Constraint
Total power generated must meet or exceed client demand:

$$\sum_{i \in I} x_i \geq D$$

$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \geq D$$

### 2. Minimum Production Constraints
If a plant is operational, it must produce at least its minimum output:

$$x_i \geq M_i \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i \in I$$

Specifically:
- $x_1 \geq 20y_1$
- $x_2 \geq 30y_2$
- $x_3 \geq 40y_3$

### 3. Maximum Capacity Constraints
Power generated cannot exceed capacity, and can only be positive if plant is on:

$$x_i \leq C_i \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i \in I$$

Specifically:
- $x_1 \leq 100y_1$
- $x_2 \leq 150y_2$
- $x_3 \leq 200y_3$

### 4. Variable Domain Constraints
- $x_i \geq 0, \quad \forall i \in I$ (non-negativity)
- $y_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i \in I$ (binary)

## Complete Formulation

$$\begin{align}
\min \quad & Z = 5x_1 + 4x_2 + 3x_3 \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \geq D \\
& x_1 \geq 20y_1 \\
& x_2 \geq 30y_2 \\
& x_3 \geq 40y_3 \\
& x_1 \leq 100y_1 \\
& x_2 \leq 150y_2 \\
& x_3 \leq 200y_3 \\
& x_i \geq 0, \quad i = 1, 2, 3 \\
& y_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad i = 1, 2, 3
\end{align}$$

## Key Properties

### 1. **Coupling Constraints**
The constraints $M_i \cdot y_i \leq x_i \leq C_i \cdot y_i$ create a coupling between the continuous variables $x_i$ and binary variables $y_i$:
- If $y_i = 0$, then $x_i = 0$ (plant is off)
- If $y_i = 1$, then $M_i \leq x_i \leq C_i$ (plant operates within bounds)

### 2. **Economic Dispatch Logic**
The model automatically implements economic dispatch:
- Plant 3 (cheapest) will be preferred when possible
- Plant 2 will be used when Plant 3 alone is insufficient
- Plant 1 (most expensive) will only be used when necessary

### 3. **Feasibility Conditions**
The problem is feasible if and only if:
$$D \leq \sum_{i \in I} C_i = 100 + 150 + 200 = 450 \text{ MW}$$

### 4. **Optimal Solution Structure**
For different demand levels:
- If $D \leq 200$ MW: Only Plant 3 operates (if $D \geq 40$ MW)
- If $200 < D \leq 350$ MW: Plants 2 and 3 operate
- If $D > 350$ MW: All plants may need to operate

## Generalized Formulation

For a system with $n$ plants:

$$\begin{align}
\min \quad & Z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i x_i \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \geq D \\
& M_i y_i \leq x_i \leq C_i y_i, \quad \forall i \in \{1, ..., n\} \\
& x_i \geq 0, \quad \forall i \in \{1, ..., n\} \\
& y_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i \in \{1, ..., n\}
\end{align}$$
